Cancellations made between 29 and 15 days prior to departure will incur a 50% cancellation fee. Unfortunately, cancellations within 14 days of departure are non-refundable.

We recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance from a reputable provider prior to your trip. Some countries may also require proof of insurance for visa applications. Our customer service team can provide guidance on choosing insurance plans that cover the specific needs of your destination and activities planned during your journey."

    question: "What kind of accommodation can I expect?",

You can expect to stay in quality 3-4 star hotels, charming guesthouses, or eco-lodges that provide a welcoming atmosphere and essential amenities such as private bathrooms, Wi-Fi, and comfortable bedding. In some remote locations, accommodation may be simpler but clean and safe, providing an authentic experience close to nature. If you have specific requirements or preferences, please inform us when booking and we will do our best to accommodate you."

We do not have an upper age limit but recommend that older travelers consult their healthcare provider before booking, especially if they have any pre-existing medical conditions. Some adventure activities or high-altitude destinations may require a higher level of fitness. We encourage families with children and seniors to contact us directly so we can recommend the most suitable trips and provide any necessary support."

Please contact our travel consultants well in advance to discuss your preferences and receive a personalized quote. Customized itineraries may affect the total price and require additional planning time, so early communication is recommended."

We also recommend bringing a reusable water bottle, insect repellent, sunscreen, and any prescription medications. Electronics such as cameras and chargers, travel adapters, and copies of important documents should be packed as well."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a visa?",
    answer: "Visa requirements depend on your nationality and the country or countries you plan to visit. Some destinations offer visa-free entry or visas on arrival, while others require obtaining a visa in advance. It is your responsibility to check and secure the necessary visas before travel. We provide general visa information on our website and can offer guidance during the booking process. It is advisable to apply for visas well ahead of your departure date to avoid delays.
