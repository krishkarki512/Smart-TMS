  description:
    "Vietnam’s diverse climate makes it a year-round destination. March and April hit the sweet spot with low to no rainfall and milder temperatures across the country. Northern areas like Hanoi and Halong Bay see cold, dry winters (December to February) and enjoy warm, sunny days from spring to autumn – ideal for those sweeping mountain views. Central Vietnam (think Hue and Hoi An) enjoys sunny skies from February to August, though August to November brings typhoon season along the coast. Down south in Ho Chi Minh City and the lush Mekong Delta, temperatures are warm year-round, with a dry season from December to May. Even during the June to November rains, brief bursts of showers bring the countryside to life in vivid green."
